## Happy Part

![](extras/product_hunt.jpg)

- The product was listed as #2 product of the day on 25th June 2019.
- [Ryan Hoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover) up voted the project
- [Ming-Yu Liu](https://twitter.com/liu_mingyu) shot a direct message on twitter
- Created so many friends from the industry


## Sad Part


- NVIDIA guys reached me and asked me to remove it from producthunt as well as playstore, as I was using their servers.
The product removed from producthunt the same day, without any notice.

>Hello – We noticed you developed an app on our SPADE / “GauGAN” code and using our back-end servers to display the rendering output. Your app ‘abcd : Anybody Can Draw’ infringes on many legal issues. It would be of great interest to remove this app from the Google Play store as well as on ProductHunt.com.
> 
>Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
> 
>Thank you,

then I replaced all NVIDIA resources with my own (even the style + artistic style images), to which they are replied

>The point was not having your own servers but how you turned GauGAN into a mobile app. This does not solve the problem.

and the final email was

>No need to talk further. I have already told you about your violations – you did not invent the AI, all you did was build the mobile app around our intellectual property.
>
> 
>
>Please remove asap before our legal is involved.

and I had to remove it from playstore :(

## Proud Part

- I removed all nvidia resources, even the style/art-style images, from the app and hosted a server myself.
